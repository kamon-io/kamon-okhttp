The `kamon-okhttp` module brings bytecode instrumentation to trace okhttp requests

The <b>kamon-okhttp</b> module requires you to start your application using the Kanela Agent.

The bytecode instrumentation provided by the `kamon-okhttp` module hooks into the client to automatically
start and finish Spans for requests that are issued within a trace. This translates into you having metrics about how
the requests you are doing are behaving.

### Getting Started

Kamon OkHttp module is currently available for Scala `2.11`, `2.12` and `2.13`.

Supported releases and dependencies are shown below.

| kamon-okhttp  | status | jdk  | scala            
|:------:|:------:|:----:|------------------
|  2.0.0 | stable | 1.8+ | 2.11, 2.12, 2.13  

To get started with SBT, simply add the following to your `build.sbt`
file:

```sbt
libraryDependencies += "io.kamon" %% "kamon-okhttp" % "2.0.0"
```
